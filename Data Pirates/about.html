                The video has garnered over 8.7 million views and over 81,220 comments, mostly appreciating the pilot
                for his move.<br><br>

                In the video, he alleged the airline has asked its pilots to do 98% of landings in "Flap 3" mode, which
                allows it to save fuel. And if not done so, it is considered as a violation of the SOP (Standard
                Operating Procedure).<br><br>

                Gaurav also discussed how landing in Flap 3 mode disregards the safety of the passengers. He gave the
                example of Imphal Airport where pilots have to deal with much steeper landings as compared to other
                Indian airports. When an aircraft comes down steeply, it needs drag to keep its speed under control. In
                these circumstances, a pilot has to perform a "Flap Full" landing.<br><br>

                But in order to fulfil the SOP's requirements, the pilot often disregards the safety of the passengers
                and does the Flap 3 landing. Gaurav Taneja was tagged as a whistle-blower for disclosing this safety
                lapse and people appreciated him for his braveness.
